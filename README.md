# challenge-6-weather
This assingment was designed to create a website that is used to allow a user to search for the weather in any city. The user should be allowed to see the current weather and the 5 day forecast. The application must store the user's inputs and allow the user to see their past inputs as a button. The button should then search again for the city's weather. For some reason, my array that I pulled into the console log was not popping up on the actual web page no matter how hard I tried. I inputted the script, but the console was not reading elements from the array and calling them undefined. I was unsure how to fix this. I got the local storage done, and I was able to make the buttons from the history to add them to the page. I have the data in the console log, but couldn't call the data on to the page. On script.js lines 43-46 is where I tried to call the data, but was unable to do so. For some reason, the local storage isn't saving in the deployed link, but it did in my local page and it is in my screenshot. The local storage code is all inside my script.js and it was working fine when I used my local browser, but it is not working on the deployed link.
